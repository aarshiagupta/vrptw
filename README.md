I built a route-optimization pipeline for the Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW) using the Solomon benchmark datasets. The system plans delivery routes that respect hard time windows, service times, and vehicle capacity, while aiming to minimize total travel distance and use a small fleet. The baseline engine is Google OR-Tools, configured with a capacity model and a time dimension (travel + service, waiting allowed). It consistently returns feasible, on-time routes and exports results/plots for easy review.
On top of the baseline, I added a lightweight heuristics layer to compare different first-solution strategies (e.g., Path-Cheapest-Arc, Savings), local search, and a simple weighted objective to balance distance vs. time. The framework logs KPIs and routes so results are reproducible across datasets and settings. Next, I’ll turn this into a small “what-if” simulator (traffic, fleet caps, depot windows, demand spikes) so non-technical stakeholders can see trade-offs instantly and choose the policy that best fits their goals.
